# Simple Mortgage

Will dockerize all this before it's done, just tired now.

## Install for now

Clone repository

Source into the venv

`pip install -r requirements.txt`

## Running

Change directory into simplemortgage (manage.py should be in there...)

`python manage.py runserver`

This runs the dev server so you can see what's there so far.. (not much but it's super fast to do the templating and what not.)
